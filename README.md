# SimpleHangmanGame
Just a simple hangman game that i had to make during Level 4 1st Year at MCAST. This was actual;ly my first real project of any sort other than some early scuffed java code I made during secondary.

**Getting it to Work**
-----------------------------
Just clone the repository and run the Nicholas_Borg_4.1D.py for it to work. The entire thing is written in base python so no external libraries need to be installed
